    Obtaining the proper documentation for your pet is probably the least exciting part of the whole process. However, it is important to register your dog in Germany as it is not only mandatory but can be seen as tax fraud if you do not do so accordingly. The good news is that it sounds harder and more time-consuming than it actually is and this article will show you exactly how to do it.
    Congratulations! You have decided to become a dog mom/ dad and are probably very excited about your new family member. But before you fully get lost in the enjoyment of your puppy I will have to tell you about something that is less thrilling - paperwork. Obtaining the proper documentation for your pet is probably the least exciting part of the whole process. However, it is important to register your dog in Germany as it is not only mandatory but can be seen as tax fraud if you do not do so accordingly. The good news is that it sounds harder and more time-consuming than it actually is and this article will show you exactly how to do it.
    When should I register my dog?
    In Germany, the laws vary with each municipality (Gemeinde). In Berlin, for example, your dog needs to be registered within a month of ownership or birth. Or immediately after you move to the city. In other cases, you can only register your puppy for dog tax when it is three months old or older. So, in other words: Get your dog licensed as soon as possible. The worst that could happen is that you would have to wait until your dog is of age, but that's still better than potentially being accused of tax fraud, right?
    How can I register my dog?
    The most common ways to register a dog are either online or in person. The easiest option is to fill out the online form provided by the official website of your municipality. You can send out the form via e-mail or to the postal address and within one or two weeks, you should receive the dog license tag (Hundesteuermarke) by mail. If you are in a hurry, the quickest alternative to get your dog licensed is in person. For this option, you need to refer to your local citizens' office (BÃ¼rgeramt). (Note that you might have to make an appointment after all.) Once you've filled out all the documents, you will receive your dogs' license tag on site."

    An expat-friendly bank lets you open an account anyway.
    The requirements to open a bank account are the same for most banks:

    A proof of German residency (your Meldebescheinigung). Some banks let you open an account without one.
    A proof of identity (your passport or national ID, and sometimes a residence permit)
    Some banks require a minimum income or financial history in Germany. Other banks require permanent residence in Germany. For example, DKB often rejects foreigners.48 Some online banks only support certain passports,49 or ask for a residence permit.

    With a ticket, you can you use all public transit options: the S-Bahn, the U-Bahn, trams, buses, ferries, regional trains and some IC and ICE trains. It does not work on Hop-On, Hop-Off sightseeing buses

    Your ticket is valid for 2 hours in one direction. You can take as many trains, buses and ferries as you want with the same ticket. You can even stop, do some shopping, and take the train again. Your ticket only works in one direction. If you want to go back, you must buy a new ticket.

    Choose the right tariff zone
    Berlin has 3 public transit zones: A, B and C:

    Zone A includes everything inside the Ringbahn.
    Zone B includes everything that's outside the Ringbahn, but inside Berlin.
    Zone C includes parts of Brandenburg like the BER airport, Potsdam and Oranienburg.
    You can buy an AB, BC or ABC ticket, depending on the zones you travel in. Most things are in zones A and B, but the BER airport is in zone C.

    If you are caught with the wrong ticket, you get a 60â¬ fine. It's like riding without a ticket.

   If you already have an AB ticket, and you want to go to zone C, get an extention ticket (Anschlussfahrausweis). It's cheaper than an ABC ticket.")

    Commerical vs. Non-Commercial Movement
    When moving to Germany (or any other EU country) with animals, the importation will be classified as either non-commercial (i.e. for personal reasons) or commercial (i.e. for business) and the appropriate set of regulations must be followed. Non-commercial import is what concerns most of us (private trips) and is where ownership does not change upon entering the country. If ownership is to change upon entry, then commercial regulations would apply. As a rule, pets must travel with their owners; you may give written permission to another person to accompany your pet, but you must be reunited your pet within 5 days of its relocation.
    Animal Limit per Person
    The second factor which determines the set of regulations that need to be followed is the species of your pet. For non-commercial purposes, generally only five (5) dogs, cats or ferrets in total may be brought into an EU country by one person. When it comes to birds, likewise a total of five (5) individuals may be imported by the one person. For rabbits and rodents, there are less restrictions - three rabits are permitted per person (permission must be requested for additional individuals), for guinea pigs, hamsters etc. there are no special conditions that need to be observed.

    There is one exception to the rule of travelling with more than the maximum allowable individual animals, which concerns temporary visits for the purpose of attending competitions or events (e.g. dog shows, sport competitions, training seminars etc.). For these conditions to be met, the pet must be at least six months old and you must carry written proof of registration for the events.

    General Requirements
    Dogs, cats and ferrets coming from another EU country need to have a pet passport and be uniquely identifiable by tattoo or microchip.
    If you're moving from outside of the EU, a health certificate with proof of a valid rabies vaccination given at least 21 days before entry (and rabies antibody titer test, if applicable - make sure to check the requirements for your country of departure) will suffice in place of a pet passport.
    For certain countries (Finland, Ireland, Malta, Norway and Northern Ireland), treatment against the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis is also required.
    Birds that are not vaccinated against bird flu need to undergo quarantine for 10 days - be sure to check the exact requirements. In addition, all birds must stay at their intended place of residence for a period of at least 30 days upon arrival before they can participate in shows or other events.
    In all cases, timing is of the essence when it comes to making preparations (vaccinations, rabies antibody tests, deworming, securing an appropriate transport carrier, booking a place for your pet on a flight etc.), so start research and planning at least six months ahead of time if coming from outside of the EU!")

      Dog liability insurance (Hundehaftpflichtversicherung) is mandatory in Berlin, Brandenburg, Hamburg, Lower Saxony and Thuringia. This insurance pays for the damages caused by your dog. It's sometimes called pet liability insurance (Tierhaftpflichtversicherung) or pet owner liability insurance (Tierhalterhaftpflichtversicherung).

      This insurance covers you if your dogâ¦

      â¦harms a person, or another dog
      â¦gets another dog pregnant
      â¦damages another person's things
      â¦damages the apartment you rent
      This insurance does not cover you if your dogâ¦

      â¦gets sick
      â¦bites a member of your family
      â¦damages your own property
      In Berlin, your coverage must be at least 1 million euros. If you travel with your dog, make sure your insurance also covers you in other countries. If your dog is a dangerous breed, make sure your insurance covers dangerous breeds.

      Hundehaftpflichtversicherung is cheap. It costs less than 5â¬ per month. Use Tarifcheck to compare prices. If you don't speak German, Feather and GetSafe offer dog liability insurance, and they speak English. They both cover dangerous breeds.

      Pet health insurance
      You can also get pet health insurance (Tierkrankenversicherung). If your dog gets sick, this insurance covers the veterinary bills. It rarely covers routine operations like vaccines or castration,8 but it covers expensive operations. This can be important when your dog gets old.

      The price of pet insurance depends on the age, race and sex of your dog. Basic coverage costs around 20â¬ per month. Full coverage costs around 60â¬ per month. Use Tarifcheck to compare prices. If you don't speak German, Getsafe offers pet health insurance, and they speak English.")

        You can get a HundefÃ¼hrerschein at certain dog schools. In Berlin, it costs 80 to 100â¬.5 You must take a theory exam, and a practical exam. In the practical exam, you must prove that your dog follows your commands.5 Your dog must be at least 15 months old.6

            In Berlin, the official name is Landesamt fÃ¼r Einwanderung, but most people still call it the AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde.
            There are two ways to go to the AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde in Berlin:

           With an appointment
           Get an appointment online, then go to your appointment. It's often impossible to get an appointment in time. You must check Berlin.de again and again. Appointments are only released for the next 3 months. New appointments are released every day.
           Without an appointment
           At the moment, you can't go to the AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde without an appointment. You can't queue in front of the AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde early in the morning. If you can't get an appointment, try applying by email.
           Is it hard to get an appointment?
           Yes, it's very hard. Look for an appointment as soon as possible. It can take weeks just to find an appointment.1 If you apply by email, it can take months to get an answer. If this is your first residence permit, you can't work, freelance or study while you wait for the residence permit.
           How to get an appointment:
           You can use the appointment booking tool, or email the AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde. You can't go to the Berlin AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde without an appointment.

           Online:
           Most of the time, there are no appointments available. This is not a bug. Keep the calendar page open, and refresh it every 5-10 minutes. If you wait too long, you must re-enter your information every time. New appointments become available at random times. They also release short-term appointments every Wednesday and Friday.2

           Sometimes, the website crashes. Wait a few minutes and try again.

           By email:
           If you can't get an online appointment, email your residence permit application to the AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde.3

           Attach all your application documents.4 A complete application might be processed faster. If you need a Fiktionsbescheinigung, say it in your message.24

           The AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde will process your application. You won't get any answer for a few months.5 It looks like they work on the most urgent cases first.

          If your residence permit expires while you wait, the conditions of your residence permit still apply. You can keep working, freelancing or studying like before.6 You should not travel outside of Germany, because you can't re-enter the country with an expired residence permit.

         By registered mail
         You can send your residence permit application by registered mail. It's exactly like if you apply by email. It's not better or faster.

         In person:
         Do not go to the AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde without an appointment. You will not get help. You can't queue early in the morning, and get what you want.

         Do they speak English at the AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde?
         Sometimes, but not always. You should bring an interpreter with you. Red Tape Translation and Booka Local can go to the AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde with you. You can also bring an immigration lawyer or a relocation consultant.

         Which AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde should I go to?
         It depends on what you need to do, and on your nationality. There are two AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde locations. There are two AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde locations: KeplerstraÃe and Friedrich-Krause-Ufer.

                For example:
                The tax ID (Steuer-ID)
                This is your unique, permanent tax identification number. Every German resident has a tax ID. The Finanzamt uses this number to identify you. It has the format '12 345 678 901'. The tax ID is permanent; it never changes. It's also called Steuerliche Identifikationsnummer, PersÃ¶nliche Identificationsnummer, Identifikationsnummer, Steuer-IdNr., IdNr or Steuer-ID.
                Why you need a tax ID
                Your employer needs your tax ID to calculate your salary tax. You do not need a tax ID to start working, but you need one to pay the right amount of salary tax. If you don't have a tax ID, your employer puts you in tax class 6, and you pay more salary tax.1 You will get that money back later, either on future paycheques, or when you file a tax return.2

               If you have children, you need their tax ID to apply for child benefits (Kindergeld), and to get a Kitagutschein.

              You also need a tax ID to start a business.

              How to get your tax ID:
              You get a tax ID when you register your address for the first time. 2 to 4 weeks later, you get a letter from the Bundeszentralamt fÃ¼r Steuern. Your tax ID is in the top right corner.
              If you registered your address before, you already have a tax ID. You just need to find it.

             If you can't register your address, fill this form. You will get your tax ID by post 2 to 4 weeks later.

            There is no way to get your tax ID faster. You can't go to the Finanzamt just after Anmeldung. You must wait for the letter.

            Where to find your tax ID
           If you already have a tax ID, you can find it here:

           On the document you got from the Bundeszentralamt fÃ¼r Steuern, after you registered your address for the first time.
           On your income tax report (Einkommensteuerbescheid).
           On your payslips (Gehaltsabrechnung).
           On your Entgeltabrechnung.
           Your employer and your tax advisor know your tax ID. Ask them.
           If you lost your tax ID, there are 2 ways to find it:

           Go to the nearest Finanzamt with your passport, and ask for your tax ID.3 You don't need an appointment.
           Fill this form, and the Finanzamt will send you a letter with your tax ID. It takes up to 4 weeks.4 They will send it to the address you registered, not anywhere else.
           The tax number (Steuernummer)
           The Steuernummer is for freelancers and businesses. It's a 10 or 11 digit number, and has the format '12/345/67890'. It's sometimes written as '3012034567890' (the first two digits are the number of your Bundesland5). It's also called Steuer-Identnummer or St-Nr.

          How to get a Steuernummer
          You get a Steuernummer when you register your business with the Finanzamt. You get it by mail, 2 to 6 weeks later.8 If it takes longer, ask your local Finanzamt on the phone or in person.

         The Steuernummer is unique, but not permanent. If you move your business to another Finanzamt's area, you will get a new Steuernummer.6

          When you get your Steuernummer, you must put it in your Impressum, and on your invoices to German customers.

         Where to find a business' tax number
         You can usually find a business' Steuernummer on their website (in their Impressum), and on their invoices.")

                  content: "Before starting elementary school (Grundschule), most children under 6 years old attend childcare (Kita). Kita is short for KindertagesstÃ¤tte. It's a type of preschool or daycare centre.

                  You must go through a few steps before your child can go to a Kita in Berlin.
                  How much does Kita cost?
                  Attending Kita is free, but food, special activities and language lessons can cost extra. The food usually costs 23â¬ per month.1 The cost of activities can cost 60 to 90â¬ per month, depending on the Kita.

                 Kitas can charge up to 60â¬ for sports, special food (such as vegan food or organic food), language lessons and activities. If the Kita provides special activities or regular breakfast and snacks for the children, they can charge up 90â¬ per month. They must itemize all costs above 60â¬, and they must allow parents to opt out of these costs.

                 Children under 1 year old can go to Kita or have a nanny (Tagesmutter) for a 4 to 5 hours per day. This is called half days or halbtags childcare. You must prove that your child requires it. You can do this by showing your work contract or freelance work commitments. Children who live in homeless shelters or collective housing can also get halbtags care.
                 Children over 1 year old get 5 to 9 free Kita hours per day.2
                 By default, children over 1 year old get 5 to 7 Kita hours per day. This is called part time or teilzeit childcare.
                 If both parents are working, studying or in training, they get 7 to 9 Kita hours per day. This is called full time or ganztags childcare. If only one parent is working, studying or in training, they only get teilzeit childcare.
                 How hard is it to find a Kita?
                 It's really hard3; even harder than finding an apartment.4 It can take more than a year to find a Kita for your child. Parents have sued the state and protested because of this.

                Most Kitas have 6 to 18 month waiting lists. Some parents start searching for a Kita during pregnancy, or while their child is a young baby, even if their child will only need a Kita in a few years.

                Start searching as soon as possible. Do not wait for your Kitagutschein to start searching.

                    content: "Step 1: Look for Kitas
                    You must look for a Kita that has a free spot for your child. This is really hard. Most Kitas have 6-18 month waiting lists. You should make a list of Kitas while you are pregnant.7 Most Kitas only add you to their waiting list after your child is born.

                    Start looking for Kitas after you move to Berlin, because you must visit them in person.8

                    There are many places to look for Kitas:

                    Kita Navigator;
                    KITA-Suche Berlin;
                    Kita.de Kita Finder;
                    Kietzee â list of Kitas with some reviews;
                    ExpatBabies Berlin â Facebook;
                    Berlin Kita sells a list of Kitas in Microsoft Excel format;
                    Kitas sometimes post a message on their windows when they have a free place. If you have time, walk around your neighbourhood, and look at the Kita doors and windows for notices. This notice often specifies the age of the children they are willing to accept, and whether they want a girl or a boy. Kitas try to keep a balance of older and younger children, and a balance of girls and boys.

                    If you live in a very high-demand area of Berlin, you might need to search for Kitas further away. Your child can attend any Kita in the city, not just the ones close to you. Due to the lack of Kita places, some Jugendamts tell Kitas to only accept kids who live in the same district.

                    Since it's extremely difficult to find a Kita, you might have to pick the first Kita that has a free spot.You can't be very picky, but you can always change Kitas later.

                    Step 2: Get a Kitagutschein
                    A Kitagutschein is a voucher that provides your child with free childcare in Berlin. The Kita needs this certificate to know how much money they will get when they take care of your child.

                    You need to apply for the Kitagutschein from 2 to 9 months before your desired start date. It takes 6 to 8 weeks to get a Kitagutschein. Some Kitas ask for a Kitagutschein before they put you on their waiting list. Others don't require it until later. They know that it's difficult to find a Kita in 2 to 9 months. However, some Kitas won't put you on the waiting list before your child is born.



                    Step 3: Contact Kitas
                    Once you have a list of Kitas, you must ask them for a spot in their waiting list. Start as soon as you are pregnant.7 You can look at Kitas before you have a Kitagutschein.

                    You will find application instructions on each Kita's website. Each Kita has a different way of getting on the waiting list.

                    When you contact a Kita, you must usually speak German. There are also some English-speaking Kitas in Berlin.

                    Kita application template â Kietzee;

                    Only a few Kitas will answer emails. If they don't answer, call and ask to visit. Many Kitas also have information days or drop-in days when you can go and ask questions.6

                    If you don't get a reply the first time you contact a Kita, or they say they have no place available, try contacting them again later.11 Sometimes, children will leave, and new places will become available.

                    Step 4: Visit Kitas
                    Many Kitas have information days or visit times.6 This is a good time to visit a Kita and ask questions.

                    When you visit a Kita, ask the following questions:

                    How many children are there, and how many teachers?
                    Are the children split up by age, or are they in different rooms/parts of the Kita?
                    Does the Kita provide food?
                    What kind of pedagogical approach does the Kita follow?
                    What are the Kita's opening hours? If you work full time, the opening hours can be a problem.12
                    How do they resolve conflicts between the children?
                    Where do the children sleep?
                    Are there any additional costs?
                    How do the Kita employees interact with you, your children and the other children?
                    You should also look at the Kita's reviews on Google Maps to make sure others had a good experience there. Some parents share their experience on various parenting Facebook groups.

                    Step 5: Signing a contract
                    Once you have found a Kita, ask them for a contract. You must sign the contract and send it back with a copy of your Kitagutschein.

                    Food is not usually covered by the Kitagutschein. It will usually cost around 23â¬ extra per month. If your Kita offers language lessons or special activities, you might need to pay extra. Each individual Kita will explain this to you.

                    Step 6: Your child's first days at the Kita
                    When your child begins at Kita, they will go through a process called Eingewohnung. This is a settling-in process that can take 2 to 5 weeks. During the Eingewohnung, you will stay with your child at first, and then gradually leave them with the Kita educators for longer periods of time until your child is settled. Leave a few weeks for the Eingewohnung between your Kita start date and the date you return to work.

                    When you choose a Kita start date and a date to begin work, factor in several weeks of Eingewohnung.")

                    content: "The new Skilled Immigration Act, which eases the entry of non-EU foreigners with professional training into the German labour market, has been in force since March 2020.  We show you what career opportunities international skilled people have in Germany and how you can find the right job.
                    German industry has a shortage of skilled workers: hundreds of thousands of jobs are vacant. That is why the Skilled Immigration Act expanded the opportunities for workers from non-EU countries to come to Germany in 2020. The clear message here is: skilled workers are welcome to stay.

                   Who is considered a skilled worker or professional?
                   They are not only graduates with university degrees that are recognised in Germany, but also workers with vocational qualifications recognised in Germany.

                   What did the law change?

                   If you do not yet have a contract of employment, but have a recognised vocational qualification, you can now obtain a residence permit for six months to find a job. During this period job seekers can work for up to ten hours a week on trial or complete a practical internship. The normal precondition for this is sufficient knowledge of German for the desired position â as a rule, to B1 standard.
                   Previously the Federal Employment Agency first had to check whether there were suitable applicants available from Germany or the EU before a business was allowed to employ a skilled worker from another country. This âpriority checkâ was dropped when the Skilled Immigration Act came into force.
                   The search for a university place or apprenticeship: graduates of German schools abroad are now not only allowed to come to Germany to study, but also to look for a university place or apprenticeship.
                   The immigration of skilled workers from non-EU countries is no longer restricted to specified âshortage occupationsâ.

                   In which occupations are there shortages of skilled workers?
                   Well trained employees are required in almost all sectors. There is high demand, for example, for doctors and nursing staff, IT specialists, engineers and, in the wake of the expansion of renewable energies, also for specialists in the fields of heating engineering and heating technology. Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic firms have been seeking personnel not only in the hotel and restaurant sector but also in the logistics industry.

                   Where can foreign specialists find information about working in Germany?
                   Make-it-in-germany.com is a website that collates information about looking for a job, qualifications, language courses, visas, the world of work and everyday formalities. The anerkennung-in-deutschland.de website also provides information about the recognition of professional qualifications.

                   Which further measures are likely to be implemented in future against shortages in skilled personnel?
                   Among other things, the Federal Government aims to further modernise the Immigration Act as part of a new skilled labour strategy. There are plans, for example, to facilitate the recognition of professional qualifications. Vocational education and further training are further pillars of the strategy.

     content: " The lease is only for a few months
      Fixed-term leases are only valid in some situations.The lease must specify why it's fixed term, or the clause is invalid, and you can stay for as long as you want. This also applies to sublets, but not to student residences and vacation apartments. This is not always a scam; many landlords just don't know the law.
      The lease says the apartment is furnished, but it's not true
        Rents are limited by the Mietpreisbremse, but that does not apply to furnished apartments. Landlords pretend that the apartment is furnished to charge more rent. Conny can help you reduce your rent.
        The previous tenant wants to sell his furniture or his kitchen
        Sometimes, the previous tenant (Vormieter) wants to sell all their furniture or kitchen to you. If you don't take the furniture, you don't get the apartment. They often charge too much, because they know that someone will buy it to get the apartment. Overcharging for furniture is illegal.
        You must pay a bribe
        The previous tenant or the landlord asks for a bribe to give you the apartment. This is illegal, but they know that someone will pay it.
        The landlord is in another country
        This is a common scam. The landlord is not in Germany, but wants to mail the keys after you pay a deposit. The apartment does not exist. They will steal your deposit money, and disappear.
         Agent fees
         You never pay an agent fee (MaklergebÃ¼hr or Provision), unless you hired the agent. Furnished apartments often have a booking fee.
        The scammer creates fake apartment listings. When you apply for the apartment, you must send many documents, like a passport and a bank account statement. They use those documents you send to steal your identity.
        Here are a few tricks to avoid scams:

        Wait before you pay;
        Don't send any money before you see the apartment in person and sign the lease. You have until the day you move in to pay the rent and the deposit. You can pay the deposit in 3 instalments. You never have to pay a fee to see an apartment, or to apply for it.
        Wait before you send documents
        Don't send your pay slips, your Steuerbescheid or a copy of your passport before you see the apartment. You don't need to share these documents to visit an apartment, only to apply for it. You should censor the parts of the documents that they don't need to see.
        Only pay by bank transfer
        In Germany, people pay their rent by SEPA transfer. Never send money by Western Union or other payment services. If you pay with cash, ask for a receipt. Use Wise to transfer money from another country. You have until the day you move in to pay the rent and the deposit, so you can also come to Germany, open a bank account, then pay your rent.
         Use common sense
         If the rent is too low, it's probably a scam. There are no cheap furnished apartments in the centre. If it's too easy to get the apartment, it's probably a scam.
         Look at the account age
        Scammers often use a new account to publish apartment listings. If the account is only a few days old, be careful.
         Use Google to search the landlord's name and IBAN on Google. You can also search for parts of their messages on Google.30 If they are a scammer, you might find some warnings online, or identical ads with different photos. If the IBAN does not start with 'DE', be careful.
         Use Google Street View
         Scammers often use photos of a different apartment. Use reverse image search to see if the photos come from another listing. Check if the apartment looks the same on the photos and on Google Street View. Is the balcony the same? Are the windows the same shape? ")

If you need a blocked account, a few Sparkasse branches offer them.42 Some lesser-known banks such as Fintiba and X-patrio also offer this service. Deutsche Bank stopped offering blocked accounts.

      If you are Indian, you can open a blocking account with Kotak Mahindra Bank, and use it to get a German student visa.

      A blocked account is not always required for a student visa. A scholarship, a proof of parental income or a guarantee can also work. If you need help with your student visa, ask your German embassy or consulate, or a relocation consultant.
