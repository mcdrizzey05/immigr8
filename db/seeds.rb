    Obtaining the proper documentation for your pet is probably the least exciting part of the whole process. However, it is important to register your dog in Germany as it is not only mandatory but can be seen as tax fraud if you do not do so accordingly. The good news is that it sounds harder and more time-consuming than it actually is and this article will show you exactly how to do it.
    Congratulations! You have decided to become a dog mom/ dad and are probably very excited about your new family member. But before you fully get lost in the enjoyment of your puppy I will have to tell you about something that is less thrilling - paperwork. Obtaining the proper documentation for your pet is probably the least exciting part of the whole process. However, it is important to register your dog in Germany as it is not only mandatory but can be seen as tax fraud if you do not do so accordingly. The good news is that it sounds harder and more time-consuming than it actually is and this article will show you exactly how to do it.
    When should I register my dog?
    In Germany, the laws vary with each municipality (Gemeinde). In Berlin, for example, your dog needs to be registered within a month of ownership or birth. Or immediately after you move to the city. In other cases, you can only register your puppy for dog tax when it is three months old or older. So, in other words: Get your dog licensed as soon as possible. The worst that could happen is that you would have to wait until your dog is of age, but that's still better than potentially being accused of tax fraud, right?
    How can I register my dog?
    The most common ways to register a dog are either online or in person. The easiest option is to fill out the online form provided by the official website of your municipality. You can send out the form via e-mail or to the postal address and within one or two weeks, you should receive the dog license tag (Hundesteuermarke) by mail. If you are in a hurry, the quickest alternative to get your dog licensed is in person. For this option, you need to refer to your local citizens' office (BÃ¼rgeramt). (Note that you might have to make an appointment after all.) Once you've filled out all the documents, you will receive your dogs' license tag on site.")
